# M1.3a -- real glass: the title bar must SHOW THE BACKGROUND, not just blur itself.
#
# What M1.2b verified and is still invisible in practice: the shader blurs the
# WINDOW OWN texture. Blurring a uniform title bar colour returns the same uniform
# colour, so there is nothing to see. The only evidence was that the title text and
# the traffic lights became unreadable -- the user words: "el fondo blanco no me
# deja ver nada, solo lo se por los botones... y el titulo".
#
# macOS does something different: the bar is TRANSLUCENT and shows the desktop
# behind it. That is what makes it read as glass instead of as smudge, and it is
# also what makes refraction, dispersion and the highlight visible at all: without
# a background showing through, every later step is invisible too.
